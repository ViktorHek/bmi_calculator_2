# BMI Calculator

## Description
The BMI Calculator is a challenge that is part of the Craft Academy Bootcamp. The core functionality of the application is to calculate the user's BMI (body mass index). This application has been the subject of a major refactoring witch resulted in that the application won't work. The actual code however should be functioning. Therefore this application is not a big priority and probably won't be in the foreseeable future.
